# IVR-Robotics

This is the completed robotics assignment by Brad Grey and Alexandra Kearney. We use Kphera Webots to simulate a small robot. We then implement a simple wall following procedure using Proportional-Derivative (PD) control to keep the robot a fixed distance away from the wall.

Finally we have an intruder-detection controller which uses the robot's on-board camera to determine if there is an intruder present in the hallway.
